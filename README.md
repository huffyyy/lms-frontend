# LMS Frontend

A clean, modern, and modular Learning Management System (LMS) Frontend, built using React + Vite.
This project is part of a full-stack LMS built with the MERN architecture (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), designed for scalability, reusability, and seamless learning workflows. Fully responsive, fast, and production-ready.

Deployed Demo (frontend-only): https://demo-fe-lms.vercel.app/
